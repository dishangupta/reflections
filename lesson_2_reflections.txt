What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It becomes a git repository. We need to do it to track different versions (snapshots) of the repository over time.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area comes between the working directory and the repository, it contains the things that would committed next to the 
	repository.
